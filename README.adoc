== Building and publishing the site

The site is built and published automatically after a push on the repository is done.
See the `Actions` tab for details.

== Documentation Versioning and Branching Workflow

Versioning of the documentation relies on branches.
Each version of the documentation stands in branches called `vx.y`.

NOTE: There's no need to merge that ' vx.y` in the main branch. The build and publish action is triggered on any `vx.y` branch push.

== Creating a New Version

. Create a new `vx.y` branch starting from the most recent branch version.
. Update the `version:` attribute of each `cti-doc_xx/content/antora.yml` and `cti-doc_xx/home/antora.yml` files according to the version name.

TIP: You can add a `prerelease:` attribute to suffix the version name as long as the content is not ready for an official release. The version will be accessible on the website, but it will not be displayed as the default version to the visitor.

== Rendering pages on your computer
We recommend either one of these two options for people working more intensely in this repository

=== Use Intelli J to render locally
* Clone the repository or Download a zip of the source files
* Install Community Edition for Intelli J https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#community-edition (We can use it for this Open Source project)
* When you open the CTI-Documentation folder, as soon as you open the first Asciidoc file, it will prompt you to install the Asciidoc plug in

=== Building the site locally

Execute the following steps:

. Building the web site UI:
* Open a terminal in the `user-interface` folder.
* Execute the following command `npx gulp bundle`
. Build the website.
* Open a Terminal in the `antora` folder.
* execute the following command `npx antora --ui-bundle-url ../user-interface/build/ui-bundle.zip --url _<absolute path to your local repository>_ --to-dir build/sites/en  antora-playbook-en.yml`.

Once built, the website is available in the `/antora/build/sites/en` folder.
